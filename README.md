# Flappy Bird WPF

Hey there, folks! Welcome to the Flappy Bird game, made using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). It's a hoot!

## How to Install and Play

1. First off, you're gonna need to clone this repository to your local machine. Use this command in your Git Bash:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Looseling/FlappyBird_WPF.git
    ```

2. After you've got it on your machine, you'll need to open the project in Visual Studio. Find the `.sln` file and open 'er up.

3. Once you've got it open, all you need to do is hit the 'Start Debugging' button or press F5. It's as easy as eating a pie!

## Game Rules

Alright, so here's the skinny on how to play:

- The game starts automatically when you run the program. You'll see a little bird on the screen - that's your character!

- Your job is to keep the bird flying and avoid the obstacles. Simple enough, right? Well, gravity is working against you and will pull your bird down if you're not careful.

- To make the bird 'flap' and move upwards, press the Space key. Letting go of the Space key makes the bird start falling again.

- You get points by successfully navigating past obstacles. The more obstacles you pass, the higher your score!

- If you hit an obstacle or fly too high or too low, that's game over. But don't worry, you can always try again!

- To restart the game after a game over, just press the R key. It's like getting a do-over!

Remember, the key to Flappy Bird is timing your flaps. Too high or too low, and it's curtains! So keep a steady hand and a keen eye.

Good luck, and happy flapping!
